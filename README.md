Use ESP32 device with RS485 to communicate with LuxPower Hybrid Inverters 8k and 10k
A sweet hardware combo for this is the M5Stack Atom Lite with Atomic base RS485
The ESP device can then be powered from the 12 V terminals of the inverter and the 2 modbus wires connect the 
RS485 base to the corresponding terminals in the inverter. No connectors needed.
